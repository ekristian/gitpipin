python-playground
===  

This project can be used as the foundation for all of your python application development needs.
It establishes a python virtual environment that enables the developer to install
and configure python to their own needs.

Clone gitpipin into your own project directory.
To install on Linux, change directories to your project directory then issue the following command.

```{bash}
$> source sbin/install
```

This will install a Python 3 virtual environment, activate it, and install the command-line program hello-world.
